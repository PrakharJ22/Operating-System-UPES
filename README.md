# Operating System UPES

This repository contains all of the Lab experiments I have performed while learning the course Operating system at UPES.

### **Experiment 1 : System calls & I/O system calls**
1. Aim: To write programs to perform following operations in UNIX:

    a)  Process Creation

    b) Executing a command
    
    c) Sleep command
    
    d) Sleep command using get pid
    
    e) Signal handling using kill

    f) Wait command
2. Aim: To write programs to perform following operations in UNIX:
    
    a) Reading from a file
    
    b) Writing into a file
    
    c) File Creation
    
    d) Implementation of ls command
    
    e) Implementation of grep command

### **Experiment 2 : Scheduling**

1. Aim: To write a C program to implement the CPU scheduling algorithm for FIRST COME
FIRST SERVE.
2. Aim: To write a C program to implement the CPU scheduling algorithm for shortest job first.
3. Aim: To write a C program to simulate the CPU scheduling algorithm for round robin.

### **Experiment 3 : Inter Process Communication**
1. Aim: Write a program that creates a child process. Parent process writes data to pipe and child
process reads the data from pipe and prints it on the screen

### **Experiment 4 : Semaphore**
1. Aim: Write a program that demonstrates how two processes can share a variable using
semaphore.
2. Aim: To write a C program to implement the Producer & consumer Problem (Semaphore).

### **Experiment 5 : Memory Management**
1. Aim: To write a C program to implement memory management using paging technique.

### **Experiment 6 : Segmentation**
1. Aim : To write a C program to implement memory management using 
segmentation.

### **Experiment 7 : File Manipulation**
1. Aim : To write a program for file manipulation to display the file and the 
directory in UNIX.
2. Aim : to write a program to perform file manipulation for creating a new 
directory.

### **Experiment 8 : Fork Execution**
1. Aim: To write a program to show the FORK Execution.
2. Aim: To write a program for implement the Fork System calls in UNIX.

### **Experiment 9 : Deadlock Avoidance**
1. Aim: To implement Banker's algorithm for a multiple resources.
2. Aim: To implement dinning philosopherâ€™s problem
